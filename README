Some commands to list shortcut keys / settings etc in the QuickPanel and

Note, you'll need to make sure the JSON is reasonably well formed. 

That means using only `//` style comments  (easily stripped before passing text

You'll also have to avoid trailing commas ( which ST3 now allows :/ )

The Default keymaps bundled with sublime unfortunately allow trailing commas.

TODO: Support fully sublime text variant of json.
