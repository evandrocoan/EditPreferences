Some commands to list shortcut keys / settings etc in the QuickPanel and
navigate to edit location on selection.

Note, you'll need to make sure the JSON is reasonably well formed.

That means using only `//` style comments  (easily stripped before passing text
to python's std lib json parser)

You'll also have to avoid trailing commas ( which ST3 now allows :/ )

Some of the keymaps bundled with sublime unfortunately contain trailing commas.

Command Palette Commands:

    { "caption": "Edit Preference: List Settings",         "command": "list_settings"},
    { "caption": "Edit Preference: List Plugins Commands", "command": "list_commands" },
    { "caption": "Edit Preference: List Shortcut Keys",    "command": "list_shortcut_keys"}

TODO:
    Restore insert binding repr command
    Handle OSX modifiers like super and command
    
    Support fully sublime text variant of json.
